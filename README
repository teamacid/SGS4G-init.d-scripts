Welcome to the init.d scripts!

This repository was created to allow us to keep an updated copy of working init.d scripts.

Before you commit any new changes to this repo, make sure you have tested the init.d script
adb shell
cd /system/etc/init.d/
./00your_script

Make sure that running it directly produces no errors and verify that it works properly when
it is run using run-parts.
Using ddms you can create a logcat filter for the 'run-parts' tag to see script output

ddms
Reboot phone
Look at logcat output

Notes:
Make sure that you chmod +x your scripts!
